# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project implements a Transformer-based Speech-to-Text (STT) model optimized for transcription services. It combines the power of a pretrained Wav2Vec2 encoder with a custom Transformer decoder to convert raw audio waveforms into accurate textual transcripts.

## 📌 Overview

The model is designed to:
- Transcribe spoken language in audio recordings into readable text.
- Utilize pretrained self-supervised models for efficient feature extraction.
- Fine-tune decoding with a Transformer-based architecture for accurate sequence generation.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: Pretrained `Wav2Vec2` (from Facebook AI) extracts robust features from raw audio.
- **Decoder**: Custom Transformer decoder layers with positional encoding and multi-head attention for generating transcriptions.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-to-text-transformer.git
cd speech-to-text-transformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:

* torch
* torchaudio
* transformers
* librosa
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sentencepiece

## 🚀 Usage

You can run the main notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
```

Steps covered:

1. Load audio and preprocess
2. Extract features using Wav2Vec2
3. Decode with Transformer
4. Evaluate accuracy using WER (Word Error Rate)

## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

* Word Error Rate (WER)
* Character Error Rate (CER)
* BLEU (optional, for sentence-level evaluation)

## 📊 Results

The model achieves strong transcription accuracy on clean speech samples and shows robustness to moderate noise. Further tuning or data augmentation may improve performance in real-world scenarios.
